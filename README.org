* About dblp2bibtex

dblp2bibtex extracts DBLP bibtex from the DBLP database.

To use it, find the DBLP page for an author of interest. E.g. for the
author:

http://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/s/Stewart:Robert_J=

Make a note of the text that follows the last ~/~ slash. In this case,
/"Stewart:Robert_J="/.

To obtain the DBLP for this author, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
dblp2bibtex --person=Stewart:Robert_J=
#+END_SRC

It is also possible to obtain bibtex for multiple authors at
once. This is done using the ~--listauthorfile=~ flag. It takes a
filename, where this file contains a list of author IDs, one ID per
line. An example is given in [[https://github.com/robstewart57/dblp2bibtex/blob/master/author-list.txt][author-list.txt]].

stack install
#+END_SRC
